### Extract Context Workflow

1. **Analyze Current Conversation**: Review the current conversation to identify key information:
   - Project details and requirements
   - Technical decisions made
   - Code patterns and preferences
   - Problem-solving approaches used
   - User-specific preferences and constraints

2. **Structure Context Information**: Organize the extracted information into sections:
   - Project Overview (purpose, goals, tech stack)
   - Key Decisions (architectural choices, library selections)
   - Code Patterns (naming conventions, structure preferences)
   - User Preferences (coding style, communication style)
   - Current Status (what's been implemented, next steps)

3. **Create brief.md File**: Generate a comprehensive markdown file containing:
   - Clear section headers for easy navigation
   - Bullet points for quick scanning
   - Code examples where relevant
   - Links to important files or resources mentioned

4. **Validate Content**: Review the generated file to ensure:
   - All important context is captured
   - Information is well-organized and readable
   - No sensitive information is included
   - File follows consistent markdown formatting

5. **Save and Confirm**: Save the brief.md file in the project root and confirm with user:
   - File location and accessibility
   - Content completeness
   - Any additional context to include
