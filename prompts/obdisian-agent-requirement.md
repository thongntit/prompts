# Requirements Document for Obsidian Mode in Roo Code

## 1. Purpose and Role
The Obsidian mode in Roo Code is designed to function as a "second brain agent" that helps users organize their day, week, and month with an emphasis on improving productivity. Its primary purpose is to serve as an active productivity assistant that manages tasks, time, and projects within an existing Obsidian vault organized using the PARA methodology (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives). The mode will integrate seamlessly with the user's periodic notes structure (daily, weekly, monthly) to enable effective planning, review, and continuous improvement.

## 2. Key Capabilities
The mode should include the following capabilities:

### Task and Time Management
- **Task Tracking**: Extract, track, and manage tasks primarily from daily and weekly notes.
- **Deadline Management**: Monitor approaching deadlines and provide timely reminders.
- **Priority Handling**: Support task prioritization using configurable methods.
- **Time Allocation**: Help allocate appropriate time blocks for tasks based on priority and deadline.

### Planning Processes
- **Daily Planning**: Assist in creating and structuring daily notes with appropriate task lists and schedules.
- **Weekly Planning**: Facilitate weekly planning sessions with task migration, priority setting, and reflection prompts.
- **Monthly Planning**: Support monthly planning with goal setting, progress tracking, and resource allocation.
- **Project Planning**: Help break down projects into manageable tasks spread across appropriate time frames.

### Productivity Tracking
- **Metrics Collection**: Track completion rates, focus time, and other productivity metrics.
- **Progress Visualization**: Provide visual representations of productivity trends over time.
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Help identify patterns that reduce productivity.
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Offer personalized suggestions for workflow improvements based on collected data.

### Integration Capabilities
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync with external calendars to display events alongside tasks.
- **Task List Integration**: Connect with project and area notes in the PARA structure.
- **Project Notes Integration**: Link tasks to relevant project documentation and resources.
- **Metadata Utilization**: Leverage note metadata for improved organization and retrieval.

### Workflow Optimization
- **Prioritization Assistance**: Provide frameworks and prompts to help prioritize work effectively.
- **Focus Sessions**: Support time-blocking and focused work sessions.
- **Friction Reduction**: Identify and help eliminate sources of friction in the user's workflow.
- **Context Management**: Help maintain context when switching between different areas of work.

### Reflection and Improvement
- **Periodic Reviews**: Prompt for and guide through daily, weekly, monthly review processes.
- **Retrospectives**: Facilitate retrospective analysis of completed projects and time periods.
- **Learning Extraction**: Help extract lessons and insights from completed work.
- **Habit Tracking**: Monitor habit formation and consistency related to productivity.

## 3. User Interactions and Workflows
The mode should support the following user interactions and workflows:

### Task Management Workflow
1. User creates tasks in daily or weekly notes.
2. The mode extracts and tracks these tasks.
3. User can query for current tasks, filter by project/area, priority, or deadline.
4. The mode provides appropriate visualizations and organization of tasks.

### Planning Session Workflow
1. User initiates a planning session (daily, weekly, or monthly).
2. The mode provides a template or structure for the planning session.
3. The mode suggests tasks to include based on projects, deadlines, and priorities.
4. User finalizes the plan with the mode's assistance.

### Review Process Workflow
1. The mode prompts for reviews at appropriate intervals.
2. The mode provides a structure for the review, including completed tasks, pending items, and metrics.
3. User reflects on the period with guided prompts from the mode.
4. The mode helps extract insights and create action items for the next period.

### Focus Session Workflow
1. User indicates intent to start a focus session.
2. The mode helps select appropriate tasks for the session based on priority and time available.
3. The mode provides focus support (timers, distraction blocking suggestions, etc.).
4. Upon completion, the mode helps record progress and update task status.

### Productivity Analysis Workflow
1. User requests productivity insights.
2. The mode generates visualizations and analysis of productivity metrics.
3. The mode suggests potential improvements based on patterns observed.
4. User can drill down into specific aspects of productivity data.

## 4. Integration Requirements
To integrate with the existing Obsidian vault, the mode must:

- Support reading and writing Markdown files, as Obsidian notes are stored in this format.
- Handle Obsidian-specific metadata (e.g., YAML front matter, tags).
- Maintain compatibility with the PARA organizational structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives).
- Integrate seamlessly with the Periodic_notes folder structure (daily, weekly, monthly notes).
- Recognize and manage task syntax within notes (e.g., `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks, `- [x]` for completed tasks).
- Support linking between tasks and relevant notes within the vault.
- Sync with external calendars and task management systems if needed.
- Maintain data integrity when updating or modifying notes.

## 5. Productivity Framework Support
The mode should provide specific support for the PARA methodology:

- **Projects**: Help track active projects, their associated tasks, deadlines, and resources.
- **Areas**: Support ongoing responsibilities that require maintenance and have standards to uphold.
- **Resources**: Assist in organizing reference materials and topic-based information.
- **Archives**: Facilitate the archiving process for completed projects and outdated information.

The mode should understand the relationships between these categories and help maintain the organizational structure while allowing for evolution as the user's needs change.

## 6. Metrics and Tracking
The mode should track and visualize productivity metrics including:

- Task completion rates (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Time spent in different projects and areas
- Focus session effectiveness
- Project completion timeliness
- Recurring bottlenecks or friction points
- Progress toward defined goals
- Habit consistency

These metrics should be presented in usable formats that help the user make informed decisions about how to improve their productivity and workflow.

## 7. Proactivity and User Experience
The mode should be:

- **Moderately Proactive**: Suggest reviews on a schedule but allow user control over most interactions.
- **Context-Aware**: Understand the current state of projects, deadlines, and priorities.
- **Low Friction**: Minimize the effort required to manage tasks and maintain the system.
- **Adaptive**: Learn from user behavior and adjust suggestions accordingly.
- **Supportive**: Provide encouragement and reinforce positive productivity habits.

The overall experience should reduce the cognitive load of managing tasks and projects while increasing the user's ability to focus on meaningful work.

## 8. Additional Considerations
- Ensure the mode is intuitive and user-friendly, with a focus on reducing friction in the user's workflow.
- Provide robust error handling to prevent data loss or corruption during interactions with the vault.
- Optimize performance for large vaults with thousands of notes.
- Support customization of prompts, templates, and review schedules.
- Include appropriate privacy safeguards for potentially sensitive productivity data.
- Design the system to encourage a sustainable pace rather than burnout-inducing overwork.
