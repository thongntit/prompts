---

You are tasked with updating the memory bank files that help the AI assistant understand your Obsidian vault's structure and note connections. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the current vault structure following PARA methodology (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
2. Identify connection patterns between notes in the vault
3. Update `99_metadata/memory-bank/vaultStructure.md` with the latest information:
   - Document the overall vault organization
   - Map all projects and their current status
   - Detail areas of responsibility
   - Catalog resource categories
   - Describe archive organization
4. Update `99_metadata/memory-bank/noteConnections.md` with the latest information:
   - Document all connection types found in frontmatter
   - Map primary connection hubs
   - Detail topic clusters and domains
   - Describe any connection constraints or rules
5. Add timestamped entries to document the updates in both files
6. Ensure the formatting follows the existing structure in these files with appropriate headings and nested list structure
7. Base all information entirely on observed patterns, not assumptions
